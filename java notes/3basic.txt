Variables and Data Types in Java:-
>Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
>There are two types of data types in java: primitive and non-primitive.

Variable:-
>Variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" that means its value can be changed.

Types of Variable:-
>There are three types of variables in java:

>local variable
>instance variable
>static variable

1) Local Variable
>A variable which is declared inside the method is called local variable.

2) Instance Variable
>A variable which is declared inside the class but outside the method, is called instance variable . It is not declared as static.

3) Static variable
>A variable that is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local.

Example to understand the types of variables in java:-

class A{  
int data=50;//instance variable  
static int m=100;//static variable  
void method(){  
int n=90;//local variable  
}  
}//end of class  

Data Types in Java:-
>Data types represent the different values to be stored in the variable. In java, there are two types of data types:

1)Primitive data types
2)Non-primitive data types

Why char uses 2 byte in java and what is \u0000 :-
>It is because java uses Unicode system than ASCII code system. The \u0000 is the lowest range of Unicode system. To get detail explanation about Unicode visit next page.

Java Variable Example: Add Two Numbers:-

class Simple{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
int a=10;  
int b=10;  
int c=a+b;  
System.out.println(c);  
}}  
Output:
20

Java Variable Example: Widening:-

class Simple{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
int a=10;  
float f=a;  
System.out.println(a);  
System.out.println(f);  
}}  
Output:
10
10.0

Java Variable Example: Narrowing (Typecasting):-

class Simple{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
float f=10.5f;  
//int a=f;//Compile time error  
int a=(int)f;  
System.out.println(f);  
System.out.println(a);  
}}  
Output:
10.5
10

Java Variable Example: Overflow:-

class Simple{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
//Overflow  
int a=130;  
byte b=(byte)a;  
System.out.println(a);  
System.out.println(b);  
}}  
Output:

130
-126
Java Variable Example: Adding Lower Type

class Simple{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
byte a=10;  
byte b=10;  
//byte c=a+b;//Compile Time Error: because a+b=20 will be int  
byte c=(byte)(a+b);  
System.out.println(c);  
}}  
Output:
20

Unicode System:-
>Unicode is a universal international standard character encoding that is capable of representing most of the world's written languages.

Why java uses Unicode System:-
>Before Unicode, there were many language standards:
>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) for the United States.
>ISO 8859-1 for Western European Language.
>KOI-8 for Russian.
>GB18030 and BIG-5 for chinese, and so on.

Problem:-
This caused two problems:
>A particular code value corresponds to different letters in the various language standards.
The encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length.Some common characters are encoded as single bytes, other require two or more byte.

 Solution:-
To solve these problems, a new language standard was developed i.e. Unicode System.
>In unicode, character holds 2 byte, so java also uses 2 byte for characters.
>lowest value:\u0000
>highest value:\uFFFF
