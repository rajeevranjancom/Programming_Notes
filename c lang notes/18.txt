Assembly program in C:-
>We can write assembly program code inside c language program. In such case, all the assembly code must be placed inside asm{} block.

Let's see a simple assembly program code to add two numbers in c program.

#include<stdio.h>  
void main() {  
   int a = 10, b = 20, c;  
   
   asm {  
      mov ax,a  
      mov bx,b  
      add ax,bx  
      mov c,ax  
   }  
   
   printf("c= %d",c);  
}  

Output:
c= 30
